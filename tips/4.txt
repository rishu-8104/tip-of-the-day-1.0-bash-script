Topic: Awk Programming
Awk is a powerful text processing language that can be used to manipulate data files and
generate reports. It operates on a line-by-line basis, reading input files and applying 
userdefined rules to each line.
The basic structure of an Awk command consists of three parts: the pattern, the action, and
the input file(s). The pattern specifies which lines of the input file should be processed, the
action specifies what should be done with those lines, and the input file(s) specifies the data
source.
Some examples of Awk code are:
• Print selected fields from a file
• Select and print lines that match a specific pattern
• Sum a column of numbers in a file
• Count the number of occurrences of a specific pattern in a file
• Replace text in a file based on a pattern
Example code:
awk '{print $1,$3}' filename.txt
This code reads the file filename.txt and prints the first and third fields of each line. The
fields are separated by whitespace by default, but this can be changed using the FS variable.
