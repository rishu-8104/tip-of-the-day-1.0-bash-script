The "launch" option, also known as "-exec", is a useful feature available in various command-line 
interfaces that allows you to execute a command or program after a specific operation has been 
performed. Here are a few tips on using this option effectively:

Check the documentation: Before using the "launch" option, make sure to read the documentation 
for the command or program you are using to ensure you understand how it works and what options 
are available.

Use quotes for complex commands: If you need to execute a complex command or a command with 
multiple arguments, it's best to enclose the command in quotes to ensure that it is executed 
properly. For example, if you want to launch a program with specific options, you might use a 
command like this:
$ myprogram --option1 --option2 -f myfile.txt -o "output.txt"
Use variables: You can use variables in your command to make it more flexible. For example, if 
you want to launch a program with a file that has a dynamic name, you can use a variable like 
this:
$ myfile="file.txt"
$ myprogram -f "$myfile"
Be careful with security: When using the "launch" option, be careful not to execute malicious 
commands or scripts inadvertently. Always double-check the command you are executing to ensure 
that it is safe.

Use dry-run mode: Many programs offer a dry-run mode or preview mode that allows you to see what 
the command will do without actually executing it. This can be a helpful way to test your command 
before actually launching it.
