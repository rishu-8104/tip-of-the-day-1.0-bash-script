Topic: Grep Command
Grep stands for Global Regular Expression Print. It is a powerful command-line utility that
searches for patterns in files or standard input and displays matching lines. Grep uses
regular expressions to search for patterns, which are sequences of characters that define a
search pattern.
Example code
grep apple fruits.txt
This command will display all lines in "fruits.txt" that contain the word "apple".
Other useful Grep options include:
-i: ignore case when searching
-v: invert the search, displaying all lines that do not match the pattern
-c: count the number of lines that match the pattern
-l: display only the names of files that contain the pattern
-n: display the line number along with the matched line
