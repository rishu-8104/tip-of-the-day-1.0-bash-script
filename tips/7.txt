Topic Tar, tape archiver
Tar is a command line utility in Linux that is used for archiving files and directories. It 
is 
short for "tape archiver" because it was initially used to create backups on tape drives. Tar 
archives multiple files into a single file, which is also called a tarball. The tarball can be 
compressed using other programs such as gzip or bzip2. Tar can also extract files from an 
existing tarball.

Some commonly used options with tar command are:
-c: Create a new tar archive.
-x: Extract files from an existing archive.
-v: Verbose output. It displays a list of files as they are being archived or extracted.
-f: Specify the filename of the archive. For example, to create a tarball named "myarchive.tar", 
you would use the option "-f myarchive.tar".
-z: Compress the archive with gzip.
-j: Compress the archive with bzip2.
